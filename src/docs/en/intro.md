Trapdoor is a Minecraft-BDS-based plugin mod which enables clearer analysis of game machanics. In other words, this plugin is specifically developed for MCBE technical players. With Trapdoor, users are allowed to assess different functions, including "increase world speed", "visible village mechanics", "visible HSA", "fakeplayers", "inquiry of MSPT and TPS", "hopper counter", "entity counter", "spawn area analysis", etc. More functions coming soon.
